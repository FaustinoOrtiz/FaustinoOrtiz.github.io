	<p style="text-align:justify">For this piece, I took a side by side screenshot from the internet of the video game character Chun Li from the game from Marvel vs Capcom Infinite. The game faced backlash when her in game model was first revealed, she looked nothing like the way fans had come to know. The issue was addressed when the game officially came out but many other characters faced the same issue and the gameâ€™s art style and character roster choice left many fans to be disappointed despite the gameplay to be super fun. With the program Notepad ++ I rewrote parts of the code to make the image return to be very glitchy and visually unappealing. This helps represent what the game turned out to be in the final product to many fans and shows that visual appeal is an important factor in making and designing a game.</p>
