		<b><p style="text-align:center"> The Tax that Sins</b></p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">For this piece I created a video that incorporates some live action and animation like elements.The video goes over a proposed tax in Pennsylvania where any video game that is rated M. As a gamer if this were to go through it could cause other states to follow suit which would hurt gamers in their wallets. They do this as a way to control the content that kids play so it won't have an influence on them doing horrific actions when research proves otherwise.</p>
