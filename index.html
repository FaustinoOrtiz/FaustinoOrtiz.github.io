    <h1>Faustino's Portfolio Site</h1>
    <p> Hello and welcome to my website! I've made this site to post my recent portfolio work. To learn more about why I am interested to be in the DMA at SJSU, read my <a href="statement.html"> Artist's Statement.</a></p>
	  <p>This link goes to my piece Comic Panel. To learn more, click here<a href="project3a.html"> ComicPanel.</a></p>
    <p>For this piece I created a sculpture of a comic book from foam poster board. The main feature of this piece is that the panels are removable making it customizable. In some pages of comics, the panels could be one huge panel, wide panels and so forth. By adding in the sliding panels as part of this design, it helps you recreate your own comic page to your liking even add in your own figures to help create a story. The background was a mixture of panels from old classic Marvel comics and the Marvel logo was made on red construction paper along with white acrylic paint to color it in.</a></p>

    <p>In this piece I mixed together the old and the new. The Rage Face meme mixed together with the distracting boyfriend meme. I picked these two memes because I felt that they would still contain the same humor that the original boyfriend meme had done but with a new twist on the idea.</a></p>

    <p>This link goes to my piece 8 bit Smash Ball. To learn more, click here<a href="project3a.html"> 8BitSmashBall.</a></p>
		<p>For this piece I created the smash ball item from the video game series super smash bros in the pc game Minecraft which helped give it its pixel like design. With the use of various programs including mesh lab and Mineways a program that lets you import a model of a highlighted target in your save file of your Minecraft game I was able to create a mesh .stl file for what I created. There were two prints the one as seen on the right was the test print to see how well the Cura 3D printer would print out the model. After changing the size of the hook in the model from Minecraft, I created a new model of the smash ball to be printed out which is the bigger one that is seen on the left. I came up with this idea because I felt that this item would be very simple to create given the tools Minecraft gives you. I also added the loop on the top so it could be made into a keychain or for a necklace which is why I made it bigger in the final version.</a></p>

    <p>This link goes to my piece 8 bit Ultron Sigma and the Infinity Stones . To learn more, click here<a href="project3a.html"> 8bitUltronSigmaandtheInfinityStones.</a></p>
    <p>For this piece, I created the final boss from the game Marvel vs Capcom Infinite and the Infinity Stones he’s trying to acquire. This was also another 3d print piece done using the same methods as the 8 bit Smash Ball piece with the addition of acrylic paint to have it match the colors of them in the game.</a></p>
  <p>This link goes to my piece Riddled with Issues . To learn more, click here<a href="project3a.html"> RiddledwithIssues.</a></p>
<p>For this piece, I took a side by side screenshot from the internet of the video game character Chun Li from the game from Marvel vs Capcom Infinite. The game faced backlash when her in game model was first revealed, she looked nothing like the way fans had come to know. The issue was addressed when the game officially came out but many other characters faced the same issue and the game’s art style and character roster choice left many fans to be disappointed despite the gameplay to be super fun. With the program Notepad ++ I rewrote parts of the code to make the image return to be very glitchy and visually unappealing. This helps represent what the game turned out to be in the final product to many fans and shows that visual appeal is an important factor in making and designing a game.</a></p>
