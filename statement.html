  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
As you will soon see most of my projects are related to video games in some shape or form.
Gaming has been my passion since I was 10 years old when I got my Game Boy Advance Sp where
I played Pokemon LeafGreen and Emerald non stop for hours on end. As a result my passion for
gaming has never been stronger which has led me to pursue a Digital Media arts degree here at SJSU to help
me achieve my dream of working in the game industry.
