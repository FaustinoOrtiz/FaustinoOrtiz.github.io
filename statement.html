  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
My name is Faustino Ortiz or you can just call me Tino for short. As a artist, the main things that interest
me are video games. I'm from San Francisco and I am currently pursuing a career in the video game industry.
This has been my dream goal since I was young and I am hoping to achieve this dream soon.

As you will soon see most of my art projects are related to video games in some shape or form.
I have always believed that if you do a project that is something that interests you and that your
are passionate about then the quality of your work will definitely show how much you like these subjects.
 As a result my passion for gaming has never been stronger and is what propels me to have a career
 in the Gaming Industry.

 The way I tried to incoroprate games into my works include topics that could have a huge impact on the industry
 as a whole. For example for my video titled The Brief Awareness of a Violent Video Game Tax it talks about the
 possibility of the government implementing a tax on games that could be demmed to violent in the hands of kids.
 I also try to implement games in other forms as well. Some of which include making a processing sketch that includes
 a character's image and their theme song or even a hand drawing. If games help fit the message that I want my viewer
 to understand then I will implement them the best way possible.
