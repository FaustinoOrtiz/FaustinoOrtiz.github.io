  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
My name is Faustino Ortiz or you can just call me Tino for short. As a artist, the main things that interest
me are video games. I'm from San Francisco and I am currently pursuing a career in the video game industry.
This has been my dream goal since I was young and I am hoping to achieve this dream soon.

As you will soon see most of my art projects are related to video games in some shape or form.
I have always believed that if you do a project that is something that interests you and that your
are passionate about then the quality of your work will definitely show how much you like these subjects.
Gaming has been my passion since I was 10 years old when I got my Game Boy Advance Sp where
I played Pokemon LeafGreen and Emerald non stop for hours on end. As a result my passion for
gaming has never been stronger and is what propels me to have a career in the Gaming Industry.
